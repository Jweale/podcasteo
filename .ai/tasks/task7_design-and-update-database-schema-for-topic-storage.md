## Description
Define and migrate the `topics` table schema to support storage of clustered topics and keywords linked to transcripts/jobs.

## Details
- Design the schema for the `topics` table (fields for cluster ID, keywords, job/transcript linkage, etc.).
- Update migration scripts or ORM models as needed.
- Ensure compatibility with analytics and downstream usage.

## Test Strategy
- Verify the table is created/updated in the database.
- Confirm that sample topic data can be inserted and retrieved.
- Check linkage to transcripts/jobs is correct.

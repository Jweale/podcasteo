## Description
Build the core logic to segment transcripts, generate embeddings, cluster segments into topics, and extract representative keywords.

## Details
- Segment transcript into sentences/paragraphs.
- Generate embeddings for each segment using OpenAI or equivalent.
- Cluster segments using cosine similarity and a clustering algorithm.
- Extract representative keywords for each cluster.
- Optimize for performance and cost.

## Test Strategy
- Run the pipeline on sample transcripts and verify clusters and keywords are generated as expected.
- Measure runtime for 10k-word transcript (<30s target).

## Description
Connect the frontend upload UI to the backend API, ensuring correct payload structure and error handling.

## Details
- Implement API calls from the frontend to the backend for transcript upload.
- Handle API responses, including success and error states.
- Ensure the frontend and backend payloads are compatible.
- Provide user feedback for upload status and errors.

## Test Strategy
- Test end-to-end upload from the UI to the backend, verifying correct data flow and error handling.
- Simulate network errors and invalid responses to ensure robust handling.

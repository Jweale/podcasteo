## Description
Benchmark the pipeline, validate clustering quality, and handle edge cases with various transcript types and sizes.

## Details
- Run the full pipeline on a variety of sample transcripts.
- Measure runtime, memory usage, and cost.
- Assess clustering quality and keyword relevance.
- Test edge cases (short, long, repetitive transcripts).

## Test Strategy
- Document results of benchmarks and quality assessments.
- Adjust pipeline parameters as needed for optimal performance.

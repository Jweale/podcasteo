## Description
Create the `GET /jobs/{id}/transcript` endpoint to allow retrieval of stored transcripts.

## Details
- Implement a REST API endpoint to retrieve the transcript for a given job ID.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization.
- Return the transcript in a suitable format (e.g., plain text or JSON).
- Handle cases where the transcript does not exist or the job ID is invalid.

## Test Strategy
- Retrieve transcripts for valid and invalid job IDs.
- Confirm correct error handling and response formats.
- Test with jobs that have and do not have transcripts.

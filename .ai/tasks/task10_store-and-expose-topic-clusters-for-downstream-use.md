## Description
Persist topic clusters in the database and provide an API endpoint for retrieval by other services or the frontend.

## Details
- Implement logic to save clusters and keywords in the `topics` table.
- Create or update an API endpoint to retrieve topic clusters for a given job/transcript.
- Ensure data is accessible for downstream content generation and analytics.

## Test Strategy
- Store sample clusters and retrieve them via the API.
- Validate data structure and accessibility from the frontend or other services.
